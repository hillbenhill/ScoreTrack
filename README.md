# ScoreTrack 
This is a class project to write a native android app the capture and share live scores on social media
We used the socialauth api to handle the security handshake between the app and twitter.
You will need to register the app with twitter and use the api keys twitter provide in the oauth_consumer.properties file.
The keys provided by oauth are for testing only. 
There is still some work to be done on the app in terms of screen rotation and backgroup etc
